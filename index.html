            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I'm an aspiring fullstack developer who loves technology and learning new things. Born in Brazil, I've lived in the US for a while and now I decided to call Germany's capital home. My passion for mathematics during high school led me to pursue a bachelor degree in Civil Engineering, but at some point I realized it is not as challenging as I had imagined.</p>
            <p>I love reading and recently I became addicted to podcasts. They make me less grumpy when I have to face the subway during rush hour. When I'm not coding or studying, I like to cross-stitch and cook desserts. </p>

            <h2>5 Podcasts to Listen to If You Are New to Tech</h2>

            <p>It has not been many months since my podcast addiction came into my life. Since learning a new language has become one of my goals, I have been looking for new tools to facilitate my immersion of the language. That's how I discovered the podcast universe. As I usually spend almost 2 hours a day on public transportation, the podcasts turned out to be my way of learning new things and making my time more productive.</p>
            <p>That's why I've separated my 5 favorite podcasts for people, like myself, beginners in the world of technology and programming.</p>
