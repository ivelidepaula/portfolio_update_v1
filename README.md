# My Personal Profile Page

This is the first project for the [Treehouse | Front End Web Development Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/front-end-web-development). The objective was to create an online profile by adding new pages, pictures and customizing texts. Only HTML and CSS were used for this project.

A live version of this project can be found [here](https://ivelisousa.github.io/portfolio_update_v1/).

### Basic Project Requirements:
* Create or find an image file to represent yourself and a new image for the background;
* Modify the HTML of the index.html file;
* Edit the href value of the Home link so it navigates to index.html. 

### Exceeds Grade Project Requirements:
* Create additional pages to expand on this online profile;
* Edit the styling of the profile photoâ€™s CSS properties;
* Add more photos and imagery to the page;
* Add more text to the page such as a list of your hobbies.

### What I added:
* Three additional pages to the website: "Blog", "Experience" and "Contact";
* Changed the grids on CSS to add an article/blog post to the main page;
* The "Read More" button when clicked leads to the page "Blog".
