        <h1>5 Podcasts to Listen to If You Are New to Tech</h1><br>
        <p>It has not been many months since my podcast addiction came into my life. Since learning a new language (German) has become one of my goals, I have been looking for new tools to facilitate my immersion of the language. That's how I discovered the podcast universe. As I usually spend almost 2 hours a day on public transportation, the podcasts turned out to be my way of learning new things and making my time more productive.</p>
        <p>That's why I've separated my 5 favorite podcasts for people, like myself, beginners in the world of technology and programming.</p>
        <h3>&#9900; <a href="https://www.codenewbie.org">CodeNewbie</a></h3>

              <p>It is not news that women are underrepresented in technology. That's why the host Espree Devora created this podcast to share stories of several women currently working in tech.
